    <h1>In Another Life, I’d Always Choose You</h1>
    <p>Maybe this life wasn’t ours to keep…  
    But if the stars ever align again,  
    I’d find you all over — in the quiet, in the chaos,  
    and I’d choose you… every single time.</p>

    <h2>When Heaven Fell to Earth</h2>

    <p>
      I was lost, drifting, unsure. Then you appeared — not walked in, appeared. Like heaven cracked open just enough to let you fall through.  
      In that instant, I felt clarity, meaning, purpose. I quit my job, I changed direction — not because I had to, but because your presence made me certain.  
      Some people walk into your life.  
      But you... you walked into my destiny.
