        <p class="intro-text">To the love of my life, my best friend, my heart's truest companion. This site is a small tribute to everything we've been through together — every laugh, every tear, every special moment. I created this for you as a reminder of how much I love you and how grateful I am for every moment shared.</p>

        <h2>How It All Began</h2>
        <p>It feels like just yesterday when our paths crossed for the first time. I never could have imagined the journey we’d take together, or the love that would grow between us. From the moment we met, I knew there was something extraordinary about you. Through laughter and challenges, we've woven a story that’s uniquely ours, and I cherish every page of it.</p>

        <p>No matter where life takes us, I will always be by your side. Our love has been tested, strengthened, and grown, and there is nothing I wouldn't do for you. Here’s to forever together, my heart. I love you, endlessly.</p>
